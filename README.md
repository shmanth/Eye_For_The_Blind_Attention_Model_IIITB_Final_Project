# Eye_For_The_Blind_Attention_Model_IIITB_Final_Project
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that approximately 285 million people are visually impaired worldwide, and out of these 285 million, 39 million are completely blind. It gets extremely tough for them to carry out daily activities, one of which is reading. From reading a newspaper or a magazine to reading an important text message from your bank, it is tough for them to read the text written in it.

A similar problem they also face is seeing and enjoying the beauty of pictures and images. Today, in the world of social media, millions of images are uploaded daily. Some of them are about your friends and family, while some of them are about nature and its beauty. Understanding what is present in that image is quite a challenge for certain people who are suffering from visual impairment or who are blind.
This is a CNN-RNN based model to help the blind. The model will convert the contents of an image and will provide the output in the form of audio.
